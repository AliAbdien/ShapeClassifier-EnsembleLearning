# ShapeClassifier-EnsembleLearning

Welcome to the "Advanced Image Shape Recognition with Ensemble Learning" project! This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning application designed to classify shapes within images using sophisticated ensemble techniques.

Key Features:

Image Processing Techniques: Implementations of various image processing functions such as reading, displaying, and converting images to binary format.
Shape Detection: Utilizes OpenCV to detect shapes and contours in images.
Ensemble Learning Models: Integration of several machine learning models including Random Forest, XGBoost, Extra Trees, and Gradient Boosting to create a robust Stacking Classifier.
Feature Extraction: A custom function to extract chain code histogram features from images, which serve as inputs to the machine learning models.
Model Evaluation: Code to split the dataset into training and testing sets and evaluate the model's performance based on accuracy.
Connected Components Detection: Functionality to identify and classify connected components in the image, demonstrating the model's ability to handle complex image structures.
Project Structure:

Python scripts for image processing and feature extraction.
Jupyter notebooks showcasing the workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
Sample images for testing and demonstration purposes.
